## 🎮 About The Game
**Obstacle Dodge 3D** is a foundational arcade game project built to explore the core concepts of Unity engine and C# scripting.

The player controls a simple cube character ("Dodgy") and must navigate through a chaotic field of falling projectiles and static blocks. The goal is to survive as long as possible without colliding with any hazards. This project focuses on physics-based movement, collision detection, and scene management.

## ✨ Key Features
* **Physics-Based Movement:** Smooth player controls using Unity's Rigidbody system.
* **Hazard System:** * **Projectile Hazards:** Objects that drop or fly into the play area.
    * **Static Obstacles:** Blocks and walls to navigate around.
* **Collision Detection:** Instant "Game Over" trigger upon hitting an obstacle.
* **Core Unity Concepts:** Demonstrates use of Prefabs, Materials, and the Unity Editor hierarchy.
